Hi, I’m Plyfaa! 

I’m a researcher passionate about visual cognition and neuroscience, currently applying to PhD programs for the 2025-2026 cycle in the United States and abroad. I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) during March 2024. 

I have been involved in research at UC Davis with David P. Corina, John M. Henderson, and George R. Mangun. During my undergraduate summers, I had the opportunity to conduct research with Kristen Pauker at the University of Hawaii - Manoa, Hawaii Pacific Neuroscience (Oahu’s main provider of neuroscience care), and Hannah Smithson at the University of Oxford. 

Currently, I am working at NIMH/NIH in Dr. Peter Bandettini's Section on Functional Imaging Methods with Post-Doctoral Fellow Sharif Kronemer on biofeedback. Our goal is to better understand how pupil size trends (i.e., dilation, constriction, peaks, and troughs) relate to shaping perceptual sensitivity and influencing cortical activity. 

Beyond research, I enjoy a good scrapbooking session and love biking and exploring local thrift shops. On the weekends, I am involved with the Naloxone Network, working to educate communities in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, MD, about Narcan/Naloxone and providing it to those in need.
