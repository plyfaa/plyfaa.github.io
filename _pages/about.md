Hi, I’m Plyfaa! 

I’m a researcher passionate about visual cognition and neuroscience, currently applying to PhD programs for the 2025-2026 cycle in the United States and abroad. I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) during winter 2024. I have been involved in research at UC Davis with David P. Corina, John M. Henderson, and George R. Mangun. During my undergraduate summers, I had the opportunity to conduct research with Kristen Pauker at the University of Hawaii - Manoa, Hawaii Pacific Neuroscience (Oahu’s leading provider of neuroscience care), and Hannah Smithson at the University of Oxford.

Beyond research, I enjoy a good scrapbooking session and love biking and exploring local thrift shops. On the weekends, I am involved with the Naloxone Network, working to educate communities in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, MD, about Narcan/Naloxone and providing it to those in need.

Please feel free to explore my academic journey and projects on my websites. Don’t hesitate to reach out!
